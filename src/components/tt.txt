Client: Agassiz.
Cb:  Okay
Client: So I was able, yeah, I was able to review the, your plan and that seemed about right to me.
        One of the things that I have is the question about whether or not Okay so if you are going to do the design and implementation of the XML doc of the xml document to have it be filable.
        That's still going to include the web form, collecting the web form in the
        Javascript Data format that we originated, right?
CB: Yes
Client: if i am understanding it, is you are going to create a translator that translates all the data that we collect using the form and then you are going to create an XML document from that JSON object, right?
CB: Yes
Client: Okay, Perfect.
        That is exactly what i want and what we both want actually. and
         so according to the number of the hoursthat you got there, you have like 180 or something like that or you know in that range.
